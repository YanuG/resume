Keeping track of my resumes over the years. 

Currently there are four branches:

- new-grad-resume: I applied to jobs using this resume for new-grad roles. 

- year-3-internship: I applied to internships/coop positions in after my third year of university. 

- year-2-internship: I applied to internships/coop positions in after my second year of university.
